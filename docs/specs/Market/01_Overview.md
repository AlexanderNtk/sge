# **Overview**

The **Market Module** is responsible for:

- **Creating**, **Updating**, **Reading**, and **Resolution** of the markets.
- This module validates the markets and registers them in the market module state.
- Users can view all active markets and place bets or become house participants using the **Bet** and **House** modules.
- Once the market is recorded on the chain, it becomes tamper-proof and can always be cross-validated.
