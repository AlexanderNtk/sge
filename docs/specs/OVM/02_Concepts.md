# **Concepts**

A straightforward process is undertaken to ensure the data's authenticity: signing with a private key and subsequent verification with the corresponding public key.

Initially, the data slated for insertion into the chain undergoes signing using a trusted private key, a step executed off-chain. Essentially, this results in the creation of an encrypted 'ticket' using the trusted private key. The chosen curve for signing and verifying these tickets is the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA), selected for its various advantages including fast single-signature verification, efficient batch verification, rapid signing, and high security levels. Further details on this algorithm can be found [here](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/).

Once the encrypted signed ticket is generated, it becomes part of the transactions. These transactions cover actions such as adding/editing betting markets on the chain and verifying odds when users engage with these markets. Each ticket includes an expiry timestamp to invalidate it after a set duration, preventing the use of old or expired tickets.

The **OVM module** maintains a catalog of trusted public keys, counterparts to the private keys used for off-chain signing and encryption of tickets. When a transaction requiring data origin verification occurs, the corresponding module calls upon the **OVM module** for verification and decryption. Serving as an interface, the **OVM module** decodes any signed data supplied to it, given the encryption algorithm and decrypted type. This design eliminates the need for OVM structural changes with ticket structure alterations, enabling the OVM to function as a universal verification module.

Upon invocation, the OVM initially verifies the data signature against the registered public keys. If the leader public key (the primary element in the public keys slice in the key vault store) successfully verifies the signature, the OVM decrypts the data into the provided structure and returns it. Failure of signature verification, ticket expiration, or mismatching decrypted structure results in verification failure, prompting an error returned to the invoking module and consequently transaction failure.

The OVM Leader, the public key used for ticket verification, resides as the initial element in the Key Vault public keys. If the leader's private key becomes compromised, holders of the remaining public keys can propose a key change, selecting a new leader. Each proposal requires at least 66.67% 'yes' votes or 2 'no' votes for blockchain code to decide its approval or rejection. Modification occurs in the end blocker upon satisfying vote conditions.
