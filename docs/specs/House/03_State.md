## **Params**

1. `min_deposit`: This represents the smallest allowable deposit amount.
2. `house_participation_fee`: This fee is calculated as a percentage of the deposit amount and is paid as part of the deposit.

```proto
// Params define the parameters for the house module.
message Params {
  option (gogoproto.goproto_stringer) = false;

  // min_deposit is the minimum acceptable deposit amount.
  string min_deposit = 1 [
    (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"min_deposit\"",
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];

  // house_participation_fee is the % of the deposit to be paid for a house
  // participation by the depositor.
  string house_participation_fee = 2 [

## **Deposit**

The deposit monitors the contributions made by users who wish to participate as house members.

```proto

## **Withdrawal**

The withdrawal system monitors the withdrawals initiated by depositor accounts.

```proto

  option (gogoproto.goproto_stringer) = false;

  // creator is the bech32-encoded address of the depositor.
  string creator = 1 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"creator\"" ];

  // withdrawal is the withdrawal attempt id.
  uint64 id = 2 [
    (gogoproto.customname) = "ID",
    (gogoproto.jsontag) = "id",
    json_name = "id",
    (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"id\""
  ];

  // address is the bech32-encoded address of the depositor.
  string address = 3 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"address\"" ];

  // market_uid is the uid of market against which the deposit is
  // being made.
  string market_uid = 4 [

    (gogoproto.jsontag) = "market_uid",
    json_name = "market_uid"
  ];

  // participation_index is the id corresponding to the book participation
  uint64 participation_index = 5
      [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"participation_index\"" ];

  // mode is the withdrawal mode enum value
  WithdrawalMode mode = 6 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"mode\"" ];

  // amount is the amount being withdrawn.
  string amount = 7 [
