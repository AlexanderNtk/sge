# **Accounts**

There is one account in the Reward module.

- Reward Pool: This account holds the reward amount transferred from the campaign `promoter` to the `reward_pool` module account.

During the campaign creation the pool amount will be transferred to the reward pool module account.

## **Grant Reward Transfer**

The reward would be transferred to the reward receiver main account (or sub account) according to the ticket payload of the grant reward transaction endpoint.
